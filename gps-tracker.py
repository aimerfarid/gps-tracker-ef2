    Args: p1, p2: tuples of (latitude, longitude) for the 'from' and 'to' points, respectively

    Latitude and longitude coordinates are represented as decimal numbers.
    The latitude is preceded by a minus sign (â€“) if it is south of the equator (a positive number implies north),
    and the longitude is preceded by a minus sign if it is west of the prime meridian (a positive number implies east).
    E.g.  p1 = (36.144698, -86.803177), p2 = (36.144871, -86.793150) -> distance: ~900m
